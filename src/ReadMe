Blocks store data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block's hash.

Each block is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, ensuring integrity.

Blocks are linked together, forming a chain where each block points to the previous one.

Validation ensures the blockchain is secure by checking if hashes are consistent.

I was being inspired by someone else's work really helpfull shoutout to CodeCrafters, Inc.
